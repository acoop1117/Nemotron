# Contributing to Nemotron

We welcome contributions to the Nemotron repository!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd nemotron
uv pip install -e .

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/
```

## Contributing Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch
2. **Make changes** following existing code patterns
3. **Write tests** for new features
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Sign commits** with `git commit -s`
6. **Submit PR** with clear description

## Adding Training Recipes

When contributing a new recipe:

- Follow the three-step pattern (data curation, training, evaluation)
- Use the Artifact system for outputs
- Support scale factors (tiny/small/medium/full)
- Include comprehensive README with model overview, hardware requirements, and benchmarks

## Code Quality

- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Use type hints and docstrings
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
