Let me start by recalling what I know about France. France is a country in Europe, known for its rich history, culture, and famous landmarks. The capital is the city where the government is based, right? I think the capital of France is Paris. Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing it with other cities. Let me think.\\n\\nI remember that Paris is a major city in France, famous for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. But is it definitely the capital? Sometimes countries change their capitals, but I don't think France has done that recently. Let me check some other facts. The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, his official residence is in Paris, I believe. The Élysée Palace is the official residence, which is in Paris. That supports the idea that Paris is the capital.\\n\\nAlso, when I think of other European capitals, like Rome for Italy, Berlin for Germany, Madrid for Spain, and so on. Paris fits into that list. I don't recall any other city in France being the capital. Maybe historically there were different capitals? For example, during different periods in history, like the French Revolution or the different regimes, the capital might have moved. But currently, the capital is Paris. \\n\\nAnother way to verify is to think about international organizations or events. For instance, the headquarters of UNESCO is in Paris, which is a United Nations agency. That might indicate that Paris is a significant city, possibly the capital. Also, major international treaties or events often take place in capitals. The Paris Agreement on climate change was signed there, which again points to Paris being the capital.\\n\\nWait, but could there be any confusion with other cities? For example, Lyon or Marseille are big cities in France, but they aren't the capital. Bordeaux is another major city, but again, not the capital. So I think Paris is the correct answer here. \\n\\nI should also consider if there's any recent change. Sometimes countries change their capitals for various reasons, like administrative or symbolic reasons. But as far as I know, France hasn't changed its capital. The last time I checked, Paris was still the capital. \\n\\nIn summary, based on historical knowledge, current government residence, presence of major institutions, and common knowledge, the capital of France is Paris. I don't see any conflicting information that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, the answer should be Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. It is the political, cultural, and economic center of the country, home to iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The French government, including the President's official residence (Élysée Palace), is based in Paris, confirming its status as the capital.\", 'reasoning_content': None, 'tool_calls': None}, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'matched_stop': 128009}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 611, 'completion_tokens': 589, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 0}, 'metadata': {'weight_version': 'default'}}\n"
